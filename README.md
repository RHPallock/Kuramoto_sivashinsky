Spectral method solvers
Fourier_KS_Newton_Raphson: Use Newton raphson to find equilibrium of KS equation
KS_Fourier_NR V2: Use newton raphson to find periodic orbit of KS equation. 
KS_Fourier_NR V2 TW: Use newton raphson to find Travelling wave of KS equation

Dedalus solver:
KS_GD_Using_Adjoint_Operator:  Folder contains the use of adjoint operator to find equilibriums of KS equation
The method is called ajoint descent which is similar to gradient descent, but here we have made a second PDE with 
adjoint operator which in the fictitious time evolution, reduce the functional norm, gradually taking us to an equilibirium.
This method works faster than regular gradient descent method.
